# Fatal Encounters with Police

In the In the United States police kill civilians at an alarmingly high rate. When compared to other deathly countries, police kill civilians at a rate over three times greater than the next highest country [(1)](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2020/06/05/policekillings/). Black lives matter protests sparked by police killings called for defunding the police and police significant police reform. However, there is still little clarity in what changes need to be made to reduce the number of fatal encounters with police. In order to address this issue I have analyzed the fatal encounters dataset, a comprehensive enumeration of all police-related deaths since 2000 [(2)](https://fatalencounters.org/).

There is obviously a significant interest to be gained from reducing the number of police deaths, but from a business standpoint, this information can be of value to police departments directly and police training companies specializing in deescalation. Governing bodies on the local, state, and federal level may also greatly benefit from this information in making decision about how to reallocate funds to further police training or to non-police agencies who may answer certain types of distress calls in lieu of police to reduce deaths.
